# Changelog

All notable changes to the **EasyEDA Agent Connector** are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions
follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.4.8] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- Marketplace manifest finalized: `repository.type` is `github` (per the official
  `eext-extension-demo`); removed the optional `bugs`/`homepage` fields — the
  marketplace flagged the `bugs` content and neither field is required. No email
  or other private data ships in the `.eext`.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-26
### Added
- `repository` field in the manifest and this `CHANGELOG.md` (marketplace
  submission requirements).

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-26
### Changed
- Release tooling keeps a **stable UUID** by default, so a new version updates in
  place (uninstall the old entry, then import); a fresh-UUID build is now an
  explicit fallback. No change to the connector's runtime behaviour.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- **Self-healing reconnection.** The connector no longer permanently gives up
  after a few failed retries. After the initial fast attempts it falls back to a
  quiet background poll, so a daemon that is started or restarted *after* the
  editor auto-connects with no manual **Reconnect**. A connection lost to a daemon
  restart also recovers on its own.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- `.eext` packaging so the extension installs reliably. Bundled a JPEG logo.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-26
### Fixed
- Netflag / netport **orientation**: corrected for EasyEDA's y-up coordinate
  system and fixed rotation handling in `connect_pin` (reverted a wrong rotation
  negation).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-25
### Added
- Initial connector: a WebSocket bridge (port-scans 49620–49629) to the
  easyeda-agent Go daemon, dispatching typed schematic actions to the official
  `eda.*` API, with auto-reconnect and a heartbeat.
- `connect_pin` composite action and the netflag/netport orientation convention.
- Header menu: **Reconnect**, **Stop**, **Toggle Auto-Connect**, **About**.
