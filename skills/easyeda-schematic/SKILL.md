# EasyEDA Schematic

Use `easyeda-agent` typed actions. Do not write raw EasyEDA JavaScript unless a typed action is missing and the user explicitly accepts a debug path.

## Workflow

1. Run `easyeda health`.
2. Read active project and schematic context.
3. Inspect before mutating.
4. Prefer small additive operations.
5. Verify each mutation by readback, snapshot, or DRC.
6. Ask before destructive operations, multi-step mutation plans, or saving.
7. Summarize changed primitives, warnings, and artifacts.

## Drawing a schematic — library-first (default)

Place **real parts from the EasyEDA / 立创(LCSC) library**, then wire them.
Hand-drawing a custom component symbol is the **fallback**, used only when the
part genuinely isn't in the library (a hand-built symbol loses the
footprint/supplier linkage and is error-prone — prefer a library part, even a
near-equivalent, first).

1. **Search** `schematic.library.search` (free-text: an MPN, value+package, or a
   name like `ESP32-S3-WROOM-1`). Each candidate carries `uuid`, `libraryUuid`,
   `name`, `footprintName`, `supplierId` (LCSC). Refine the query if it returns
   the wrong category — `100nF 0402` can match resistors; add `X7R` or use the MPN.
2. **Place** `schematic.component.place` with the chosen `{libraryUuid, uuid}` at a
   coordinate → a manufacturable part with correct symbol + footprint + LCSC number.
3. **Read pins** (`schematic.components.list` / pin readback) for exact pin
   coordinates before wiring.
4. **Wire**: net flags for the power/ground rails; for a local signal net, route
   short wires that all meet at ONE junction point (star node) so EasyEDA junctions
   them — see the Electrical Rules below (pin → wire → flag, never flag-on-pin).
5. **Verify** with `schematic.drc.check` + the data linter
   (`tools/schematic-lint/lint.sh <project>`), and fix what it reports.

## Phase 1 Actions

Run `easyeda actions` for the current machine-readable action list.

Core schematic operations:

- `project.current`
- `document.current`
- `schematic.pages.list`
- `schematic.page.open`
- `schematic.components.list`
- `schematic.component.place`
- `schematic.component.modify`
- `schematic.component.delete`
- `schematic.wire.create`
- `schematic.netflag.create`
- `schematic.select`
- `schematic.snapshot`
- `schematic.drc.check`
- `schematic.save`
- `schematic.export.netlist`
- `schematic.export.bom`

## Guardrails

- Confirm before deleting primitives.
- Confirm before saving unless the user explicitly asked to save.
- Confirm before running a generated multi-step mutation plan.
- Do not claim completion after mutation until verification succeeds or the remaining risk is stated.
- Treat `File` and `Blob` outputs as artifacts.
- If DRC fails, report violations and propose the smallest repair step.

## Layout Conventions

When placing components, follow [docs/schematic-layout-conventions.md](../../docs/schematic-layout-conventions.md):
- Zone map (power left, MCU center, RF/sensors right, big modules in corners)
- Module spacing rules (80–500 units depending on size + pin count)
- Wire stub lengths (20–40 units for power, 20–60 for signals)
- Right-angle-only routing, decoupling caps within 30 units of VCC pins

## EasyEDA Electrical Rules (load-bearing — DRC will fatal if ignored)

EasyEDA's DRC does **not** treat two primitives sharing the same coordinate as electrically connected. Every connection needs a real `schematic.wire.create` between them. Two concrete consequences:

1. **`schematic.netflag.create` MUST NOT be placed on the same point as a pin.** Placing a +3V3/GND/IN/OUT flag at the exact pin coordinate produces a DRC fatal: *"端点重叠且未连接 / endpoints overlap but not connected"*. The flag sits on top of the pin visually but EasyEDA treats them as two disjoint endpoints.

   Correct pattern: pin → short wire → netflag at the wire's far end. Typical offset: 20 grid units (EasyEDA uses 0.01 inch / grid unit on schematics). Example for `+3V3` on `R1.pin1 @(265, 440)`:

   ```text
   schematic.wire.create     points = [265,440, 245,440]   # pin to a free point
   schematic.netflag.create  x = 245, y = 440, kind=power, net="+3V3"
   ```

2. **Wires must have non-zero length.** A wire of `[x,y, x,y]` is silently ignored; a wire of `[x,y, x+0,y+0]` will not register a connection.

3. **NC pins still need explicit marking.** A pin without any wire/flag triggers a "悬空 / floating" warning even if your design intends it unused. Use a Non-Connected flag for those.

Apply this rule when generating any power/ground/port connection — emit the wire first, then place the flag at the wire's free endpoint.

## Missing Actions

When a needed operation has no typed action:

1. Decompose it into existing actions if possible.
2. Otherwise state the missing action name and expected inputs/outputs.
3. Use `debug.exec_js` (raw `eda.*` JavaScript) only as a temporary, user-confirmed debug escape hatch. Its result must be JSON-serializable — base64-encode any `Blob`/`File` inside the snippet.
4. Recommend promoting repeated debug code into a typed action.
